# Linear Regression Example: Head Size and Brain Weight Analysis

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use linear regression to analyze the relationship between head size and brain weight. The dataset used in this project includes the head size (in cubic centimeters) and brain weight (in grams) of 237 adult individuals.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

These libraries can be installed using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

To use this project, simply clone or download the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. This Notebook contains the code and explanations for loading and exploring the dataset, training a linear regression model, and visualizing the results.

The Notebook is divided into sections that correspond to different parts of the analysis, and each section includes detailed comments and explanations. You can run each section by clicking on the cell and pressing Shift+Enter.
